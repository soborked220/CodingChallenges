Refactoring steps:

- write safety harness for the method

1. Identify the code you want to extract, and comment it out
2. Think of a name for the new method and create it as an empty method
3. Place a call to the new method in the old method
4. Copy the code that you want to extract into the new method
5. Find out what parameters you'll have to pass and learn what values you'll have to return
6. Run your tests
8. Delete the commented-out code
